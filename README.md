# Real-Time VST Plugin (JUCE-based)

This branch contains the implementation of a real-time VST plugin that integrates the wave digital (WD) model developed in the MATLAB branch. The plugin is designed to demonstrate the practical applicability of the model in audio production environments.

## Plugin Description

The plugin emulates the nonlinear behavior of the reference analog circuit using the precomputed WD structure. It supports real-time audio input/output and parameter control.

> ⚠️ The plugin is still under refinement. Performance tuning, UI improvements, and testing on different DAWs are ongoing.
