# Real-Time VST Plugin (JUCE-based)

This branch contains the implementation of a real-time VST plugin that integrates the wave digital (WD) model developed in the MATLAB branch. The plugin is designed to demonstrate the practical applicability of the model in audio production environments.

## Plugin Description

The plugin emulates the nonlinear behavior of the reference analog circuit using the precomputed WD structure. It supports real-time audio input/output and parameter control.


### üîä Sound Characteristics

- **Amp-style dynamics** ‚Äì Touch-sensitive gain, reacts like a tube amp  
- **Wide gain range** ‚Äì From edge-of-breakup to full-stack crunch  
- **Open, uncompressed tone** ‚Äì Preserves transients and clarity  
- **Transparent or aggressive** ‚Äì Switchable voicing via LP/HP modes


### üéöÔ∏è Controls

- `Drive` ‚Äì Adjusts overdrive intensity  
- `Tone` ‚Äì Shapes highs without getting harsh  
- `Volume` ‚Äì Controls output level  
- `LP / HP Switch`  
  - **LP (Low Peak):** Smooth, flatter EQ for rhythm or stacking  
  - **HP (High Peak):** Focused mids, tighter lows for leads

## Requirements

- **Operating System**
  - Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
  - macOS 10.14 ‚ÄúMojave‚Äù or later

- **Plugin Format**
  - VST3 (compatible with most modern digital audio workstations)

- **DAW Compatibility**
1. **Clone the repository (optional, for developers):**
   ```bash
   git clone --branch JUCE https://github.com/stepoliste/OCD.git
   
2. Locate the Built Plugin

After building the plugin using JUCE's Projucer or an IDE like Xcode or Visual Studio, you will find the compiled plugin file here:
OCD/builds/OCD.vst3

3. Install the Plugin Manually

#### On Windows

- Copy the file `OCD.vst3` into your system VST3 folder:
  C:\Users<YourUsername>\AppData\Common\VST3\

  
- If the `VST3` folder doesn't exist, you can create it manually.

- Restart your DAW and rescan plugins if necessary.

#### On macOS

- Copy the `OCD.vst3` plugin bundle into the system-wide VST3 directory:
  /Users/<YourUsername>/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/


- To access the `Library` folder, open Finder, press **Cmd + Shift + G**, and enter the path manually.

- Restart your DAW to detect the new plugin.



4. Insert the Plugin in Your DAW

- Load **"OCD"** onto an audio track or effects bus.
- Adjust the parameters to shape your sound.
